# OQC Technical Test

## Introduction

This project was designed to show my software and algorithmic capabilities for the Algorithm Developer position at Oxford Quantum Circuits. 

## Objectives

Objective is to develop a set of algorithms related to optimization of gates in quantum circuits. 

## Setting up your environment for tests

1. `$ python -m venv venv`
2. `$ source venv/bin/activate` or `$ .\venv\Scripts\activate` if you are using windows
3. `$ python -m pip install --upgrade pip` 
4. `$ pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Running on shell

To run the file just type

1.   `$ python main.py`.

Tasks 1, 2, and 3 were completed. I ran out of time for task 4 due to a bug that I've found in my code.
